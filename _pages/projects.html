    <strong>Governance Fragmentation and the Tragedy of the Commons: A Spatial Econometric Analysis of Groundwater Extraction in the U.S.</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>  
    <p>
      This paper investigates how governance fragmentation affects groundwater extraction in the United States, drawing on the broader literature on the “tragedy of the commons” and institutional design. The study develops a game-theoretic framework in which neighboring jurisdictions share an aquifer and can either compete or coordinate over extraction. Simulations show that when governance is more evenly fragmented across districts, competition intensifies, leading to higher extraction and faster depletion; by contrast, highly asymmetric governance structures dampen over-extraction. The model also underscores the role of intertemporal preferences in shaping extraction paths. From this theoretical basis, two testable hypotheses are derived: (i) higher fragmentation should be associated with increased withdrawal (manifesting as greater stress and lower remaining availability), and (ii) extraction decisions should be spatially interdependent across districts. Empirically, the paper combines county-level measures of groundwater outcomes with original indicators of governance fragmentation. The baseline fixed-effects results show that more fragmented governance is associated with higher perceived groundwater stress and lower physical groundwater availability, even after controlling for geology, land use, socio-economic conditions, and urban influence. Spatial autoregressive and error models reveal strong and precisely estimated spatial dependence in both outcomes, confirming that local extraction and scarcity are tightly coupled across county borders. The negative association between fragmentation and physical availability is strongest in low-permeability settings and attenuated, but not reversed, in high-permeability counties; heterogeneity by agricultural dependence points in a similar direction. A broad set of robustness checks, including alternative spatial weights matrices, sample restrictions that trim or winsorise extremes, and variants of the control set and functional form, leaves these qualitative patterns intact. To probe potential endogeneity in governance structure, the paper also estimates IV models that use variation in the 19th-century PLSS township grid as instruments for fragmentation and its interaction with geology. First-stage diagnostics indicate strong instruments, and over-identification tests do not flag obvious violations; at the same time, the IV results suggest that part of the observed negative correlation between fragmentation and physical availability reflects endogenous institutional responses to scarcity. The PLSS-based estimates are therefore treated as robustness and as suggestive evidence on the direction of bias, but taken together with the fixed-effects and spatial models they reinforce the broader conclusion: the spatial organization of groundwater governance is systematically linked to patterns of stress and depletion, in ways consistent with tragedy-of-the-commons dynamics operating in a spatially connected resource system.

    <strong>Building Knowledge Graphs from Classical Chinese Manuscripts with LLMs</strong> <em>(in progress)</em>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <p>
      This project develops a framework for digitizing and extracting structured knowledge from historical Chinese texts written in <em>wenyan</em> (Classical Chinese). It seeks to integrate digitization, character normalization, and punctuation restoration with fine-tuned large language models to achieve accurate interpretation of unpunctuated, context-dependent passages. The models are being trained to handle tasks including named entity recognition, event extraction, and relational mapping, with the goal of transforming raw manuscripts into structured knowledge graphs that capture the people, places, events, and institutions recorded in the texts. Ultimately, the project aims to enable semantic querying of complex historical records and to provide historians with a powerful tool for detecting patterns, validating interpretations, and linking disparate archival sources within a unified digital knowledge base.
